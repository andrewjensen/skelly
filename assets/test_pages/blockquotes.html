            <h1>Blockquotes</h1>

            <p>Here comes a blockquote:</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>
                    This is a blockquote. It is used to highlight a block of
                    text. It is usually indented on the left side.
                </p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>
                This next blockquote is going to have multiple paragraphs
                inside:
            </p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>This is the first nested paragraph. It's looking neat.</p>
                <p>
                    This is the second nested paragraph. It's looking neat as
                    well.
                </p>

                <p>In fact, here's a nested list:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>First item</li>
                    <li>Second item</li>
                    <li>Third item</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Super neat!</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>That's enough blockquotes for now.</p>
